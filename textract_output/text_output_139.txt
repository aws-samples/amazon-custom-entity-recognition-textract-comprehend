UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm
>
This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window
A* (MAWA*) which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-
bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the
nemory-bounded A* like approach to handle restricted memory situations.
Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented.
Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show
the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.
