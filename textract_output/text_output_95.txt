Description:
CSPC is a collector which is integrated with different CSOs (Common Service Objects) like the
device discovery CSO, core collection, connectivity and data normalization. Together we call as
CSPC or Common Services Platform Collector.CsPc-N is an add-on service which is written
on top of the CSPC i.e., extra software written by the Nos team based on the CSPC 2.0 base
code to cater to a group of customers. CSPC-NOS support on both Windows and Linux Cent Os
platform. The Windows CSPC-NOS client can connect to the CSPC-NOS Linux server and vice-
versa. Devices can be added manually or using the import seed file. when importing a seed file/
when Device discovery is triggered the Device discovery module collects light inventory data
from the devices. The light inventory data contain information like Sys Object Id, device family,
OS-version etc. (This information collected can be seen by going to Reports->Managed Devices)
This light inventory data is used by the inventory module to load the model rule for the respective
device. This data is also used by the base collector to decide whether the device is managed
or unmanaged.
